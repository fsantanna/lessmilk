# Game development in CÃ©u-SDL

##

### Creating a window
  We are creating a window and waiting 2 seconds before closing it.
### Drawing a square
  We are rendering a red square on the screen
### Closing a window
  We are waiting for the SDL_QUIT event to close the window and escape the tight loop
### Changing color every second
  We are changing the square color periodically
### Moving the square with time (with the color still changing)
  We are moving the square independent of the frame rate while maintaining the color change behavior
### Moving the square with the keyboard
### Animation
### Enemies
### Collision
### Result: Game 1
